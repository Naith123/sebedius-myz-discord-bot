1-2;**SKITTERING MENACE:** The Facehugger has chosen its host and they know it is coming for them! It skitters forward, single-minded and horrifyingly spider-like. The victim suffers +1 STRESS LEVEL and must make an immediate Panic Roll.
3;**TAIL LASH:** The little monster comes for its target, lashing out with its wicked tail. It attacks with five Base Dice, Damage 1. (The Royal Facehugger uses six Base Dice, base Damage 2). Aside from any damage the victim gets +1 STRESS LEVEL.
4;**TAIL GRAPPLE:** The Facehugger leaps and catches its victim from behind, its tail whipping violently. Roll a D6:\n> 1–2: The target’s legs are caught and they fall prone—make a Panic Roll.\n> 3–4: The victim’s arms get hopelessly tangled in the beast’s tail—they cannot use any held items and must make a Panic Roll.\n> 5–6: The Facehugger wraps its tail around the target’s neck, choking them—they suffer the effects of DROWNING and must make a Panic Roll.
5;**FACE GRAPPLE:** The Facehugger leaps at its victim. Make an opposed roll with six Base Dice against the target’s `CLOSE COMBAT` skill (not counting as an action for the victim):\n> If the Facehugger wins, the target will suffer THE FINAL EMBRACE (below) on the Facehugger’s next initiative.\n> If the victim wins they throw the beast to the floor, but it’s not finished with them yet and attacks the same target again on its next initiative.
6;**THE FINAL EMBRACE:** The Facehugger gets to its victim, its acid making short work of any helmet or respirator in the way. Roll for the attack with six Base Dice. If it gets one or more, the poor victim is facehugged and immediately Broken. Their last sensations are horrible, yet strangely loving: a firm but gentle caress around their head. A smothering sensation followed by a warm burst of oxygen-rich air filling their lungs. A deep sensation of slow-motion falling. It’s okay to fall asleep…
