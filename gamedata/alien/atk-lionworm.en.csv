1;INTIMIDATING DISPLAY;The Lion Worm rears up, its golden cilia flowing in threatening patterns. But it’s a bluff. The expert predator has seen a problem and is using an aggressive display to cover a tactical retreat (which it makes on its next action). All PCs within `SHORT` range must make a Panic Roll. But the Lion Worm is not giving up the hunt: when it retreats, stealth mode resumes with the Lion Worm still hunting the PCs. When it makes its next attack, it gets a +1 to its roll on this table (to a maximum of 6).
2;PLAY WITH ITS PREY;The Lion Worm attacks but for fun, rather than to kill. Roll for the attack with eight Base Dice. If the attack hits, the target is knocked to the ground and drops all hand-held items, but is otherwise unharmed. The Worm rears over them, wishing for its prey to run before it attacks again. The victim must make an immediate Panic Roll.
3;ACRID PHEROMONES;The Lion Worm releases a huge dump of pheromones into the air. They are so pungent that anyone near the creature starts to cough and all PCs within `SHORT` range must make a `STAMINA` roll. If unsuccessful they are stunned and lose their next slow action.
4;FERAL RAGE;The beast attacks, throwing everything at its victim, with ten Base Dice, Damage 2. If it causes any damage, its insatiable desire to kill allows it to immediately make a second attack as a free action, with the same number of Base Dice and Damage rating.
5;CRIPPLING ATTACK;The Lion Worm attacks to incapacitate its target, either to eat later or get enough space to escape a bad situation. It goes for a crippling blow, making an attack with eight Base Dice, Damage 1. If it does any damage it automatically inflicts critical injury #56, even if the victim isn’t Broken. Type `{prefix}crita 56`.
6;DEATH ROLL;The Lion Worm goes full out for the kill, grasping its target and wrapping it in a vicious death roll. Roll for the attack with ten Base Dice, Damage 1. If the attack hits, the victim is grappled as well as disorientated and loses their next slow action. On its next action, the Lion Worm will squeeze the victim, attacking with ten Base Dice, Damage 1 again.
