1;ASSESSING THE THREAT;The Xenomorph pauses, hissing quietly but all the more threatening for that. It looks like it’s thinking, or maybe giving silent orders to unseen companions. Everyone within `MEDIUM` range gets +1 `STRESS LEVEL`.
2;ONE FOR ALL;The Xeno leaps at the largest group of enemies and roars a challenge, sweeping its arms, legs and tail through their ranks. All targets within `SHORT` range must succeed at a `MOBILITY` roll or be knocked off their feet, taking one point of damage. All the targets must make immediate Panic Rolls.
3;ALL-OUT ATTACK;The Xenomorph launches into a wild attack, throwing every claw, fang and its pointed tail at its victim. It attacks with twelve Base Dice, Damage 2, and the attack is armor piercing.
4;CAPTURE FOR THE HIVE;The Xenomorph attacks with its venom-spiked tail, with twelve Base Dice, Damage 1. If the attack causes any damage, the Xeno pulls its punch so only one point of damage is inflicted, and the paralyzing venom takes effect. The victim must make a `STAMINA` roll—the number of {success} rolled is the number of Rounds they can stay up, then they fall unconscious for one Shift. The paralysis can be removed with a shot of adrenaline (a `MEDICAL AID` roll using a Medkit), but otherwise the Xeno will capture them for the egg chamber.
5;DIE FOR THE QUEEN;The Xenomorph, desperate to protect its hive and Queen, leaps towards an enemy, eviscerating itself as it does so. Its acid blood showers everywhere: all targets within `SHORT` range of the Xeno suffer an immediate acid splash attack of twelve Base Dice. The Xeno dies, squealing.
6;HEADBITE;The Xenomorph opens its outer jaws wide, and the deadly inner jaws lean out, gnashing in anticipation before snapping forwards. The attack is rolled with ten Base Dice, Damage 2. If it causes any damage it automatically inflicts critical injury #64, killing the victim in one dreadful blow. Type `{prefix}crita 64`.
