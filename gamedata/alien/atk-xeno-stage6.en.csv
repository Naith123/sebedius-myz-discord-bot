1;CALL THE GUARD;The enormous Xenomorph lets out a shrill cry for help, calling D6 Sentries (for the Queen) or Soldiers (for the Praetorian or Crusher) to its defense. They reach the zone the following Round, then draw initiative and can act.
2;CHARGE;Crusher only (re-roll for Praetorian or Queen). The target must make a `MOBILITY` roll (no action) or be crushed, being immediately Broken and suffering a random critical injury. Even if the victim makes the roll, they fall down and gain +1 `STRESS LEVEL`.
3;BEASTLY BITE;The Xenomorph takes a huge bite from its victim. The attack is rolled with ten Base Dice, Damage 1. If the attack causes any damage, it inflicts critical injury #61 even if the victim isn’t Broken, triggering a Panic Roll. Type `{prefix}crita 61`.
4;CRUSHING BLOW;The Xenomorph brings its entire weight down on the poor victim, who must make a `MOBILITY` roll at –2 (no action) or be crushed, immediately suffering three critical injuries (roll three times on the critical injury table and apply all three results, regardless of whether or not the victim is Broken). The victim is knocked to the ground and must make an immediate Panic Roll.
5;TAIL SPIKE;The tail impales the victim with terrible force. Roll for the attack using ten Base Dice (fourteen for a Queen), Damage 1. The attack is armor piercing. If the attack causes any damage it automatically triggers critical injury #66, killing them outright. Type `{prefix}crita 66`.
6;HEADBITE;The Xenomorph opens its mouth wide and the inner jaws lash out. The attack uses ten Base Dice, Damage 2. If it causes any damage the victim immediately suffers critical injury #64, killing them in one dreadful blow. Type `{prefix}crita 64`.
