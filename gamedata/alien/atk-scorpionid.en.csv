1;RETREAT;The Scorpionid isn’t stupid and won’t fight unless there’s a good reason to. On this occasion it decides to flee the fight as quickly as possible.
2;PINNED DOWN;The Scorpionid uses its powerful pincers to pin down its target. Roll for the attack using ten Base Dice, Damage 1. If the attack hits, the target is knocked prone, drops any hand-held items and must make an immediate Panic Roll.
3;PINCER GRAB;The creature tries to seize its victim in its enormous claws, quivering with the anticipation of a quick strike with its huge tail. Roll for the attack with eight Base dice, Damage 1. If the attack hits, the victim is grappled (see page 93) and must make an opposed roll for `CLOSE COMBAT` against eight Base Dice to break loose. If the Scorpionid retains its grasp, it will automatically make a **TAIL STRIKE** (n°4) attack against the victim on its next initiative. If this attack hits underwater the Scorpionid will drag the victim deeper and one zone away from the group, causing them to also suffer the effects of drowning.
4;FLAILING STRIKE;The Scorpionid’s pincer swipes at its target. Roll for the attack with eight Base dice, Damage 1. If the attack hits, the Scorpionid flings the victim into the next zone, causing an immediate critical injury (regardless if the victim is Broken). Type `{prefix}crita`. The victim is left prone and drops any hand-held items.
5;TAIL STRIKE;The Scorpionid swings its terrible tail forward with deadly purpose. It attacks with ten Base Dice, Damage 1. If it inflicts any damage it poisons the victim with a deadly venom, counting as a disease with a Virulence rating of 9 (see page 109).
6;IMMOBILIZE;The Scorpionid wants to escape, but to do so it needs to take its attackers out of the fight. It lunges for its victim’s legs with its huge claws, making an attack with eight Base Dice, Damage 2. If it does any damage, the victim immediately suffers critical injury #35, whether or not they are Broken. Type `{prefix}crita 35`.
