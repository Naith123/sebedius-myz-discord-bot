1;**HYPNOTIZING GAZE:** The Xenomorph, eyeless as it may seem, stares deeply into the soul of its victim. The victim is mesmerized by the dread beauty of such a beast. They stand in awe of what nature, or god, or the devil has created, get +1 STRESS LEVEL and must make an immediate Panic Roll.
2;**PLAYING WITH ITS PREY:** The Xeno attacks, but not to kill. The target is knocked to the ground and drops all hand-held items, but otherwise takes no damage. The Xeno morph stands over them, taunting its prey to run so the game can go on. The victim gets +1 `STRESS LEVEL` and must make an immediate Panic Roll.
3;**DEADLY GRAB:** The beast launches through the air, grabbing its victim. It attacks with ten Base Dice, Damage 1. If it hits it immediately drags them into a neighboring zone, dumping them on the floor. The victim is prone, drops all hand-held items and must make an immediate Panic Roll.
4;**READY TO KILL:** The Xenomorph grabs its victim, its inner jaws poised to strike. Roll for the attack with ten Base Dice. If it hits, the victim counts as grabbed (see page 93) and needs to make an opposed `CLOSE COMBAT` roll against ten Base Dice to break loose. The victim and all friendly characters in the same zone must make Panic Rolls. Unless the victim breaks free, the Xenomorph will use a **HEADBITE** attack (n°6) against them on its next initiative.
5;**CAPTURE FOR THE HIVE:** The Xenomorph attacks with its venom-spiked tail, with ten Base Dice, Damage 1. If the attack causes any damage, the Xeno pulls its punch so only one point of damage is inflicted, and the paralyzing venom takes effect. The victim must make a `STAMINA` roll—the number of {success} rolled is the number of Rounds they can stay up, then they fall unconscious for one Shift. The paralysis can be removed with a shot of adrenaline (a `MEDICAL AID` roll using a Medkit).
6;**HEADBITE:** The Xenomorph opens its outer jaws wide, and the deadly inner jaws lean out, gnashing in anticipation before snapping forwards. The attack has a strength of nine Base Dice, Damage 2. If it causes any damage it automatically inflicts critical injury #64, killing the victim in one dreadful blow. However, should the GM wish it, the victim remains just alive enough for the Xeno morph to initiate the ovomorphing process. Type `{prefix}crita 64`.
