# Available Commands

Commands are triggered with the prefix `!` or by mentioning the bot. This prefix can be configured for your server. The commands can be executed from channels and some of them privately through DMs.

### Vocabulary

Below you'll find a list of available commands. The instructions use the following scheme:

* Chevrons `<...>` mean that the argument is mandatory for the command to work.
* Brackets `[...]` mean that the argument is facultative.
* Vertical bar `|` means "OR". *E.g. `d6|d66` means you can type either d6 or d66 for the command.*

### Generic commands

* `help [command name] [--no-dm]` ‚Äì The bot's manual. Read it! Use the `--no-dm` argument to diplay the help message on the channel.

  * `<speed>` ‚Äì Number of initiative cards to draw. Default: 1.

Type `!help <command>` for a list of aliases for a specific command.

# Permissions

This is a detailed list of needed permissions:

* `ADD_REACTIONS` : The bot uses a reaction menu for roll pushing.
* `VIEW_CHANNEL` : Mandatory.
* `SEND_MESSAGES` : Mandatory.
* `MANAGE_MESSAGES` : The bot needs this permission to remove pushing reaction emojis.
* `EMBED_LINKS` : The bot uses rich embed to display the dice results.
* `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` : The bot cannot react to its own message without this permission. ‚ö†Ô∏è<span style="color: red;">**NEW**</span>
* `USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS` : The bot uses custom dice emojis.

### Troubleshooting

If the bot is missing any permission above, it might not work properly.

| Symptoms | Probable Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Roll command: the push emoji reaction is not removed after a few minutes.| `MANAGE_MESSAGE` is missing. | See below. |
| Roll command: the push emoji reaction don't appear at all and the roll can't be pushed | `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` is missing. | See below. |
| The bot does not respond to a command. | Latency, wrong prefix, or bot crash. | Wait and retry. Check latency with command `!ping`, check the prefix by mentioning the bot. |

1. Check that the bot has all the required permissions in the server (check its role).
2. Check also that it has no denied permission in the channel (maybe the role `@everyone` or another one is removing the needed permission).
3. Kick the bot and re-invite it to your server using the link at the top of this Readme.
4. As a last resort, you can temporary give full admin rights to the bot, it'll fix all permission problems.
4. Contact me for extra support, I'll be glad to help.
