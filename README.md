# Available Commands

Commands are triggered with the prefix `!`. This prefix can be configured for your server. The commands can be executed from channels and some of them privately through DMs.

### Vocabulary

Below you'll find a list of available commands to use. The instructions use the following scheme:

* Chevrons `<...>` mean that the argument is mandatory for the command to work.
* Brackets `[...]` mean that the argument is facultative.
* Vertical bar `|` means "OR". *E.g. `d6|d66` means you can type either d6 or d66 for the command.*

### Generic commands

* `help` ‚Äì The bot's manual. Read it! Use the `--no-dm` argument to diplay the help message on the channel.
* `initiative [quantity]` ‚Äì Draws one or more initiative cards. The deck is specific to each Discord server. Use the parameter `shuffle` to reset it. *(Which is probably needed at the beginning of every new encounter.)*
* `ping` ‚Äì Checks the bot's latency.
